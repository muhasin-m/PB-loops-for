# Programming Basics: For Loops

**write your answers in solution.js**

These exercises are designed for practising "for" loops. Print all your results to the console.

## Task 1 - Addition

Write a program to add up the numbers from 1 up until 20.

At the end, output the result to the console.

Expected output:

```plaintext
210
```

## Task 2 - There are i bottles of beer on the wall

Write a program that iterates over the numbers from 1 to 5.

At each iteration, output a message to the console as follows:

```plaintext
There is 1 bottle of beer on the wall
There are 2 bottles of beer on the wall 
There are 3 bottles of beer on the wall 
...
```

## Task 3 - The odd/even reporter

Write a program that iterates over the numbers from 0 to 20.

At each iteration, output a message to the console that says if a number is `even` or `odd`.

Expected output:

```plaintext
0 is even
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
...
```

## Task 4  - Multiplication Table of 9

Write a program that iterates over the integers from 0 to 10.

At each iteration, multiply the current number by 9 and output a message to the console showing the multiplication and its result.

Expected output:

```plaintext
0 * 9 = 0
1 * 9 = 9
2 * 9 = 18
3 * 9 = 27 
...
```

### Task 4.1 - Multiplication tables from 1 to 10

Write a program similar to the `Task 4` above, but this time use a nested for loop to show all the multiplication tables for every number from 1 to 10.

Expected result:

```plaintext
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
...
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6
...
...
...
10 * 1 = 10 
10 * 2 = 20 
10 * 3 = 30 
```

In the end, you should have 100 lines output to the console.

## Task 5 - Fizz Buzz

Write a program that iterates over the integers from 1 to 100.

At each iteration it should output to the console:

- `Fizz`, if the current number is a multiple of 3
- `Buzz`, if the current number is a multiple of 5
- `FizzBuzz`, if the current number is a multiple of both 3 and 5
- the number itself in all the other cases

Expected output:

```plaintext
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
...
```

## Task 6 - Sum of Multiples

Write a program to calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 up to 1000 (1000 included) that are multiples of both 3 and 5.

Expected output:

```plaintext
33165
```

## Extra tasks
